# Jarvis-HEP
Just a Really Viable Interface to Suite for High Energy Physics. 

Jarvis-HEP is a high-energy physics (HEP) data analysis and simulation framework developed in Python, designed to simplify the process of data handling and analysis for researchers and students in the field of particle physics.

## Features

- Supports various sampling methods, enabling comprehensive parameter space exploration.
- [AI-based data analysis methods for HEP](https://github.com/karlschwarz/AI_for_HEP) are under active development and will be integrated into the repository. Check out the [demo](https://github.com/Pengxuan-Zhu-Phys/Jarvis-HEP/blob/master/simu/sample_dynamic_viz.gif) for the visualization of the sampling procedure.
- Integrated with popular HEP computational modules and libraries for seamless analysis workflows.
- Asynchronous and parallel computing support for optimized performance on large datasets.
- Data management and storage solutions tailored for high-volume data processing, including input/output handling and database integration.

## Installation
Jarvis-HEP is a pure Python code, using pip install the following package:
