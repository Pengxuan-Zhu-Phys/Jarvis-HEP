#-------------------------------------------------------------

Although it may be possible to build the HepMC libraries from this directory,
we recommend that you create a separate build directory and work from there.

Although it may be possible to build with autotools, 
we strongly recommend building with cmake. 
Cmake is preferred for MacOSX and required for Windows.
Cmake is also required if you are using clang, or any non-gcc compiler.

Please see either INSTALL.cmake or INSTALL.autotools for directions.
