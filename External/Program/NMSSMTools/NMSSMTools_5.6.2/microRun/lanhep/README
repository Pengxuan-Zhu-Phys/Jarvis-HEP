This directory presents lanHEP source files  for NMSSM.

1) file gi_Nmass.src 

We restore  neutralino mass matrix NMMij  and use 
NMM11    0    NMM13  NMM14   0
 0     NMM22  NMM23  NMM24   0
                     NMM34   0
                            NMM45
                            NMM55

to improve Lagrangian to discribe Neutralino mass/mixing by GI manner. 


2)  file improve_squarks.src

We define MbMM and MtMM on the scale of corresponding squarks.
Restore   squark mass matrix: 
  a) Correct Ab -> AB and At->AT  to reproduce off-diagonal term.
  b) Add  
      lterm dX3*(EE/SW)**2*(s_H2*tau*s_h2)*(s_Q3*tau*s_q3)/4.
which shifts both   MMt11 and MMb11 on 

     +1/2*MW**2*dX3*sb**2

but in differente sides. 

It gives complete gauge invariance, if dX3 choosen in such a way to
reproduce mass martix.  But dX3 typically > 1. ( dX3=1 corresponds to
SU(2) DD term). The same trick for first 2 generation gives dX1,dX2 << 1.  
May be mixing angle is wrong ( say, was calculated before diagonalizing ..)????
  
3) Quark masses:

   MbMM and MtMM as well as AB AT are  contibute to superpotential  which lead
   to unwanted values of quark masses. It is improved in  file Yukawa.src. 
   deltaMb correactions are implemented in the same time.
   
 
4) s-quark mixig for first 2 generation.
   It needs for direct detection. We assume that u,d,s quarks have the same
   small mass Mq. Result should not depend on this mass while it small.
