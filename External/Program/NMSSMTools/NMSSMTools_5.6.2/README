HOW TO USE NMSSMTOOLS:

After the download of NMSSMTools_x.tgz (where x is the version number),
type "tar zxvf NMSSMTools_x.tgz". This will create a directory named
NMSSMTools_x. Go into this directory. 
There you find the directories 
-- "sources", "main" and "microRun", which contain source files;
-- "EXPCON", which contains data files corresponding to experimental
    constraints;
-- "SAMPLES", which contains sample input and output files; 
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

COMPILATION:
    
To compile, type first "make init", then "make". A first compilation
may take a while, since many subroutines of micromegas are compiled.
The following executable routines are created in the directory "main":
nmhdecay, nmhdecay_rand, nmhdecay_grid, nmhdecay_mcmc,
nmspec, nmspec_rand, nmspec_grid, nmspec_mcmc,
nmgmsb, nmgmsb_rand, nmspec_grid, nmspec_mcmc,
nmhdecayCPV, nmhdecayCPV_rand, nmhdecayCPV_grid, nmhdecayCPV_mcmc.
If a subroutine in the directory "sources" was modified, one has to
type "make init" and "make" again. If a routine in the directory
"main" was modified, it suffices to type "make" again.
To delete all the already compiled codes type "make clean".


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

INPUT FILES:

From the version 2.0.0 onwards, the task to be performed by an input
file is independent from its name. Any name is allowed, provided it
contains the three letters "inp"; it can be of the general form
PREFIXinpSUFFIX where PREFIX and SUFFIX can contain dots etc..

The input file can be located in any directory specified by a PATH.

To run any input file PREFIXinpSUFFIX, type "run PATH/PREFIXinpSUFFIX".
(PATH is optional; if absent, the input file has to be located in the
same directory as the script file "run".)

The output files are located in the directory specified by PATH.
They have the following format: 
If one single point in the parameter space is evaluated:
   PREFIXspectrSUFFIX (includes the previous PREFIXdecaySUFFIX) and
   PREFIXomegaSUFFIX (if the relic density is computed, see below)
If scans are performed:
   PREFIXerrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXoutSUFFIX 

However, the task to be performed by an input file must be specified in
the BLOCK MODSEL at the beginning (see the SLHA2 conventions in 
B. Allanach et al., SUSY Les Houches Accord 2, arXiv:0801.0045
[hep-ph]).

The BLOCK MODSEL should contain at least the first four among the following lines:

The meaning of the integers I1..I10 is as follows:

I0=0: general NMSSM with parameters specified at the SUSY breaking scale
      (an average of the squark masses, unless specified by the user).
      As in the previous versions of NMSSMTools, the input parameters
      have to be given in the BLOCK EXTPAR following the SLHA2
      conventions. Z_3 violating terms are allowed.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inp.dat.

I0=1: mSUGRA-like boundary conditions at the GUT scale with universal
      scalar masses m0, gaugino masses M12 and trilinear couplings A0
      (to be specified in the BLOCK MINPAR). Z_3 violating terms are
      allowed.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpsp.dat.

I0=2: GMSB-like boundary conditions as in the paper U. Ellwanger et al.,
      arXiv:0803.2962 [hep-ph]. Z_3 violating terms are allowed
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpgm.dat.

I0=3: Z_3 invariant NMSSM with parameters specified at the SUSY breaking
      scale (an average of the squark masses, unless specified by the user).
      As in the previous versions of NMSSMTools, the input parameters
      have to be given in the BLOCK EXTPAR following the SLHA2
      conventions. Z_3 violating terms as input generate an error message.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpZ3.dat.

I0=4: Z_3 invariant mSUGRA-like boundary conditions at the GUT scale with
      universalscalar masses m0, gaugino masses M12 and trilinear
      couplings A0 (to be specified in the BLOCK MINPAR).
      Z_3 violating terms as input generate an error message.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpsp.dat.

I0=5: Z_3 invariant GMSB-like boundary conditions.
      Z_3 violating terms as input generate an error message.


I1=0: CP conserving parameters

I1=2: CP violating parameters


I2=1: A scan over a grid in parameter space is performed. The
      boundaries in parameter space as well as the corresponding
      numbers of steps have to be specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/gridinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/gridinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/gridinpgm.dat
      
      The output file PREFIXerrSUFFIX gives the number of points which
      have passed all constraints, and the corresponding range of input
      parameters.
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX contains details of points which
      have passed constraints; the latter can be modified by the user
      by editing the corresponding routines in the directory "main":
      
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX is created in the subroutine
      OUTPUT near the end of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general NMSSM),
      or nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA) or nmgmsb_grid.f (GMSB). 
      If the first line in the subroutine OUTPUT reads
      "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0)THEN", properties of points with phenomenological
      problems are not written into PREFIXoutSUFFIX.
      If this line reads "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0 .OR. IFAIL.EQ.10)THEN", points
      with phenomenological problems are written as well. 
      The properties which are listed in PREFIXoutSUFFIX depend on the
      content of the array RES and should be specified by the user.
      The meaning of the various arrays containing Higgs and sparticle
      masses and mixing angles, Higgs branching ratios is given at the
      beginning of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general NMSSM), 
      nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA) or nmspec_grid.f (GMSB). For convenience,
      we list the content of the array PAR(I) (the couplings and soft
      terms at the SUSY scale) as well as the content of the array
      PROB(I) (phenomenological and some theoretical constraints)
      below.

I2=2: A random scan in parameter space is performed. The boundaries in
      parameter space as well as the total number of steps have to be
      specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/randinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/randinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/randinpgm.dat
      
      For the content of the output files PREFIXerrSUFFIX and
      PREFIXoutSUFFIX (and the treatment of the latter) see the
      description of the case I2=1 above; the corresponding MAIN
      routines for random scans in the directory "main" are denoted by
      nmhdecay_rand.f, nmspec_rand.f and nmgmsb_rand.f.
      
I2=3: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo scan in parameter space is performed.
      The relative and the minimum size of each step for all
      parameters and the total number of steps have to be specified.
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/mcmcinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/mcmcinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      examples SAMPLES/mcmcinpgm.dat.
      
      For the content of the output files PREFIXerrSUFFIX and
      PREFIXoutSUFFIX (and the treatment of the latter) see the
      description of the case I2=1 above; the corresponding MAIN
      routine for a MCMC scans in the directory "main" are denoted by
      nmhdecay_mcmc.f, nmspec_mcmc.f and nmgmsb_mcmc.f.

      
I3=0: The dark matter relic density is not computed.

|I3|=1: The dark matter relic density is computed and checked via a call
      of micromegas. A first call of micromegas provokes the
      compilation of additional subroutines, which may take a while.
      For GMSB models, only the non-thermal relic density of the
      gravitino (coming from NLSP to gravitino decay) is computed,
      i.e. micromegas computes the NLSP relic density and multiplies
      the result by the mass ratio of gravitino over NLSP.

      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      relic density Omega*h^2 is given in the output files
      PREFIXspectrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXomegaSUFFIX. The latter
      contains in addition informations on the decomposition of the
      LSP and the relevant annihilation/coannihilation processes.
      The names of particles in the final states of the annihilation
      and coannihilation processes are the same as in micrOMEGAS and
      can be found in: G. Belanger, F. Boudjema, A. Pukhov and A. Semenov,
      micrOMEGAs: A program for calculating the relic density
      in the MSSM, Comput. Phys. Commun. 149 (2002) 103
      [arXiv:hep-ph/0112278].
      If I3>0 constraints on relic density from Planck +/- 10% are checked:
       0.107 < Omega h^2 < 0.131
      If I3<0 only the upper bound is imposed:
       Omega h^2 < 0.131
      
|I3|=2: Same as I3=1 + direct detection cross sections are computed.
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      BLOCK NDMCROSSSECT in PREFIXomegaSUFFIX contains:
      csPsi = proton  spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csNsi = neutron spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csPsd = proton  spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]
      csNsd = neutron spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]
      Constraints from LUX (arXiv:1310.8214) are checked

|I3|=3: Same as |I3|=1 + the thermally averaged LSP annihilation cross section
      as well as the resulting photon spectrum are computed. In the case of
      a single point in parameter space (I2=0), these are written in the
      BLOCK ANNIHILATION of PREFIXomegaSUFFIX:
      sigmaV = LSP annihilation cross section.

|I3|=4: Same as |I3|=2+3.


I4=0: Precision of the CP-even/odd/charged Higgs masses:
      1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
	      contributions ~ g1, g2, lambda and kappa to LLA
      2-loop: top/bottom Yukawa contributions to LLA

I4=1: as in G. Degrassi, P. Slavich, Nucl.Phys.B825:119-150,2010, 
      arXiv:0907.4682 (with special thanks to P. Slavich);
      corrections to the charged Higgs mass from K.H.Phan and P. Slavich:
      1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
	      complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      (except for pole masses)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas*alpha_S

I4=2: 1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
	      complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      including pole masses (slow!)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas*alpha_S

I4=1,2: for Z_3 invariant NMSSM only (I0>2).

I4=3: same as I4=0 + computation of Higgs mass uncertainty by varying the RG scale by *2 and /2.

I4=4: same as I4=1 + computation of Higgs mass uncertainty by varying the RG scale by *2 and /2.

I4=5: same as I4=2 + computation of Higgs mass uncertainty by varying the RG scale by *2 and /2.

I4=6: same as I4=3 + check that uncertainty is < 3 GeV.

I4=7: same as I4=4 + check that uncertainty is < 3 GeV.

I4=8: same as I4=5 + check that uncertainty is < 3 GeV.

I4>2: for general NMSSM at the SUSY scale only (I0=1,3)


I5=1: Constraints on (g-2)_muon are imposed (default value)

I5=0: They are not imposed (for scanning versions only, I2=/=0)


I6=0: no particular GMSB model assumed above the messenger scale
      MS and Alambda can be given as free input parameters at MMESS

I6=1,3: Delgado/Giudice/Slavich model (from arXiv:0706.3873[hep-ph])
      with unified singlet-messenger coupling at the GUT scale xi_U
      The value of xi_U is given in BLOCK EXTPAR, switch 73

I6=2,4: Delgado/Giudice/Slavich model without universality
      with a triplet coupling LTT and a doublet coupling LPP 
      given at the messenger scale in BLOCK EXTPAR, switches 74, 75

I6=1,2: Evans/Ibe/Yanagida model (from arXiv:1107.3006[hep-ph])
      without messenger-Higgs mixing. The parameters LU, LD, LT
      LB, LL are given at MMESS in BLOCK EXTPAR, switches 76 to 80.

I6=1,2: Evans/Ibe/Yanagida model with messenger-Higgs mixing.
      LT, LB are given at MMESS in BLOCK EXTPAR, switches 78, 79.
      The others are given by LD=L*LT/HT, LU=L*LB/HB, LL=HL*LB/HB

If I6=/=0: ALAMBDA cannot be given at MMESS as it is related to the
      extra messenger couplings above MMESS. XIF=XIS=MU'=MS'^2=0.
      KAPPA and MUEFF and MS are computed from the minimisation eqs.
      On the other hand MS is also related to the extra couplings.
      DMIN, the maximal relative deviation allowed between the computed
      and expected value for MS, has to be given in BLOCK EXTPAR (switch 0).
      If the deviation is larger than DMIN then:
      IFAIL=21 (if previously = 0)
      IFAIL=22 (if previously = 10).


I7=0: Sparticle total widths and branching ratios not computed

I7=1: NMSDECAY is called, which computes sparticle 2-body and 3-body
      branching ratios as in
      SDECAY: A Fortran code for the decays of the supersymmetric 
	 particles in the MSSM
      by M. Muhlleitner (Karlsruhe, Inst. Technol.),
        A. Djouadi (Orsay, LPT & CERN, Theory Division),
        Y. Mambrini (Orsay, LPT),
      Comput.Phys.Commun.168:46-70 (2005), hep-ph/0311167.
     SDECAY should be cited whenever NMSDECAY is used.
     In NMSDECAY.f in the directory sources, the flags 
        "flagmulti" (3-body decays)
        "flagqcd" (QCD corrections to 2-body decays)
        "flagloop" (loop decays)
     can be switched off; otherwise a call of NMSDECAY takes about 2-3 seconds
     per point in parameter space.
     In the versions nmhdecay.f and nmspec.f, the sparticle widths and BR's are
     appended to the output file PREFIXspectrSUFFIX in SLHA2 format. If scans are
     performed, the user can use the arguments of the COMMON statements in the
     subroutines OUTPUT in order to define the content of the output file.


I8=0: No double-offshell H->V*V* decays (faster)

I8=1: Double-offshell H->V*V* decays (slower)


I9=0+0/1: micromegas fast computation of resonances on/off
    +0/2: minimal Boltzman suppression for coannihilation = 1d-3/1d-6
    +0/4: virtual Ws off/on


I10=1: The name of the output file PREFIXspectrSUFFIX remains unchanged, but it can
be renamed as param_card.dat, useful for MadGraph.

At least for the version MG5_aMC_v2_2_3 the following procedure seems to work:
1) Place a proc_card.dat in the directory MG5_aMC_v2_2_3. The proc_card.dat should
   contain a line "import model nmssm", possibly adding "-modelname" (which changes
   the syntax for Higgs bosons into h01, h02, h03, a01, a02). Generate the process
   typing "./bin/mg5aMC proc_card.dat". This generates a directory "PROC_nmssm_x"
   where "x" is a number.
2) Go into this directory. Replace the (default) param_card.dat in the subdirectory
   "Cards" by your desired param_card.dat. Edit the run_card.dat if desired.
3) Generate events typing "./bin/generate_events" and reply to the subsequent
   questions as desired. Inside the directory "PROC_nmssm_x", this procedure can
   be repeated with different cards. Good luck!


I11=1: Landau poles and false minima constraints are imposed (default value)

I11=0: They are not imposed (for scanning versions only, I2=/=0)

Sparticles: M2, AU3, AD3, AE3, ML3, ME3, MQ3, MU3, MD3 have to be
given. Unless specified otherwise, the code assumes
M1=M2/2, M3=3*M2, AE1=AE2=AE3, ML1=ML2=ML3, ME1=ME2=ME3,
MQ1=MQ2=MQ3, MU1=MU2=MU3, MD1=MD2=MD3

NMSSM-specific parameters in the Higgs sector:

The soft Higgs mass terms MHU^2, MHD^2 and MS^2 are always computed in
terms of MZ, TANB and MUEFF.

Always to specify: TANB, LAMBDA and MUEFF

Note: values of commented parameters (including KAPPA) are assumed = 0,
unless they are computed as output.

Options for the parameter set "ALAMBDA, MA, XIF" where
MA=diagonal doublet-doublet entry in the CP-odd mass matrix:
Two out of these three parameters have to be specified,
the remaining one is computed.
(If all are commented, MA is computed assuming ALAMBDA=XIF=0,
if only MA is input, ALAMBDA is computed assuming XIF=0,
if only ALAMBDA is input, MA is computed assuming XIF=0,
if only XIF is input, MA is computed assuming ALMBDA=0)

Options for the parameter set "AKAPPA, MP, XIS" where
MP=diagonal singlet-singlet entry in the CP-odd mass matrix:
Two out of these three parameters have to be specified,
the remaining one is computed.
(If all are commented, MP is computed assuming AKAPPA=XIS=0,
if only MP is input, AKAPPA is computed assuming XIS=0,
if only AKAPPA is input, MP is computed assuming XIS=0,
if only XIS is input, MP is computed assuming AKAPPA=0)

Note: If KAPPA=0, AKAPPA must be =0

In the output file, the values of the computed parameters are
shown in the BLOCK EXTPAR, but commented.

PARTICULAR CASES:

Z_3-invariant NMSSM:
Always to specify: TANB, LAMBDA, MUEFF, KAPPA, and in addition
- either ALAMBDA or MA, and
- either AKAPPA or MP.
If too many of these latter parameters are specified, XIF and/or XIS
are computed and indicated in the output.

nMSSM (kappa=Akappa=0, but XIF, XIS non-vanishing):
Always to specify: TANB, LAMBDA, MUEFF, and in addition
- two parameters of the set (XIF, ALAMBDA, MA), the remaining parameter
is computed, and
- MP or XIS, the remaining parameter is computed.

M3 are not specified, M1=M2/2 and M3=3*M2.

For each parameter "P", P_max=P_min if P_max is not specified.
P_min=0 by default, except for TANB, LAMBDA and MUEFF which have to be
specified, and except for the parameters which are computed.
Unless P_min=0 by default, P_max cannot be given if P_min is not known.
(If KAPPA=0, AKAPPA is set = 0.)

The user has to specify the total number of points.


***************************************************************************************
INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMHDECAY_GRID:
***************************************************************************************

The choice of independent parameters is as above.
The user has to specify the number of points "NP" for each parameter
to be scanned. By default NP=1. If P_max > P_min and NP=1, P_min is
used. If P_max=P_min and NP>1, the user is alerted by a warning.


***************************************************************************************
INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMHDECAY_MCMC:
***************************************************************************************

For MCMC scans, the user has to provide a starting point with parameters
as for NMHDECAY. For each parameter P, the user has to give the relative
and the minimum step size PDEV and PMIN (resp.). Then, at each step, the
new value of P is computed as: PNEW=P+MAX(DABS(P),PMIN)*PDEV*GAU where
GAU is a random number with a gaussian distribution (mean=0, width=1).
Whether the new point is taken as the new starting point for next step
of the random walk or not depends on the value of a penalty function
which is a sum of all the discrepancies of the chosen point with respect
to experimental bounds. The total number of scanned points is given in
BLOCK STEPS as NTOT and the initial random seed as ISEED.


***************************************************************************************
INPUT OPTIONS FOR NMSPEC:
***************************************************************************************

The user has to specify TANB, LAMBDA, M0, M12 (unless all M1, M2 and M3
are specified separately) and A0.
ALAMBDA and AKAPPA (both at MGUT) can be specified independently from
A0, if desired.
MHD^2 and MHU^2 (both at MGUT) can be specified independently from m0,
if MUEFF is NOT specified.

Default values for all other parameters (unless computed in terms of
others) are =0.

By default, KAPPA is computed in terms of the other parameters. If KAPPA
is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general. If neither KAPPA
nor XIF are given as inputs then KAPPA is computed assuming XIF=0. Both
parameters cannot be simultaneously inputs.

By default, the singlet soft mass MS^2 at MGUT is computed in terms of
the other parameters and hence =/= m0 in general. If MS^2 is input, XIS
is computed instead and hence =/= 0 in general. If neither MS^2 nor XIS
are given as inputs then MS^2 is computed assuming XIS=0. Both
parameters cannot be simultaneously inputs.

By default, MUEFF is computed in terms of the other parameters, but then
its sign SIGMU (FLOAT, not INTEGER) must be given.

If MUEFF is an input parameter, KAPPA, XIF and XIS are also interpreted
as input parameter (with default value =0 unless specified otherwise).
Then the Higgs soft masses MHD^2, MHU^2 and MS^2 at MGUT are computed in
terms of the other parameters and hence =/= m0 in general.

By default, XIF=XIS=MU'=MS'^2=M3H^2=0, but can be specified otherwise
(at MGUT).
Exceptions: If MUEFF is NOT an input parameter and
- if KAPPA is input: XIF is computed and hence =/= 0 in general;
- if MS^2 is input: XIS is computed and hence =/= 0 in general.

PARTICULAR CASES:

cNMSSM (fully constrained Z_3-invariant NMSSM): Not possible as input;
at least MS^2 at MGUT is an output

sNMSSM (semi-constrained Z_3-invariant NMSSM, with non-universal singlet
sector):
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, M0, M12, A0, ALAMBDA, AKAPPA
-> KAPPA, MUEFF and MS^2 are computed.

NUH-NMSSM (Z_3-invariant NMSSM with non-universal Higgs masses MS^2,
MHD^2 and MHU^2 at MGUT):
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA, AKAPPA),
MUEFF
-> MS^2, MHD^2 and MHU^2 are computed.

nMSSM (no self coupling for the singlet): 
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), XIS
-> XIF, MUEFF, MS^2 are computed;
or
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), MS^2
-> XIF, MUEFF, XIS are computed.
Inputs TANB, LAMBDA, KAPPA=AKAPPA=0, M0, M12, A0 (possibly also ALAMBDA), MUEFF, XIF, XIS
-> MHU^2, MHD^2, MS^2 are computed.

If GMSB = 0:

The definitions of the parameters specific to GMSB models
can be found in JHEP 0805 (2008) 044 (arXiv:0803.2962).

The user has to specify TANB, LAMBDA, MSUSY (SUSY scale), MMESS

is always computed). ALAMBDA (at MMESS) can be specified if =/=0. AKAPPA
is always =3*ALAMBDA.

Default values for all other parameters (unless computed in terms of
others) are 0.

By default, KAPPA is computed in terms of the other parameters. If KAPPA

Soft parameters at MMESS are related to these extra couplings.

DMIN, the maximal relative deviation allowed between the computed
