1. To compile the package launch

    gmake  or make

The Makefiles of CalcHEP uses gmake facilities. If you have not 
'gmake' command, it means that your 'make' works like 'gmake'      

In case of success you should get a messahe 

# CalcHEP has compiled successfuly and can be started.
  ..............

2. If in result of compilation you get a warning
  # CalcHEP has compiled without X11.   
    .......
it means that X11 header files are  not detected on your computer and 
CalcHEP interactive mode will not work. The problem can be solved by
installation on your computer  one of additional packages:

   libX11-devel     for  Fedora/Scientific, Darwin(MAC)                          
   libX11-dev       for  Ubuntu/Debian                                           
   xorg-x11-devel   for  SUSE        

3. To create a directory for CalcHEP working sessions call

   ./mkWORKDir < directory name> 
   
It is possible to create several working directories. 
We don't recommend to create working directories inside CalcHEP.

4. To start  CalcHEP session  go to the working directory 
and call 
     ./calchep

5. By default CalcHEP   contains  only two versions of SM, one with complete 
CKM matrix and another (CKM=1) with diagonal CKM.
   The realizations of  Beyond the  Standard  Models have to be 
download independently. To install such models the user has to 
a) download the corresponding <model>.tgz file. 
b) unpack it; In result directory <model> with CalcHEP model files and 
   codes for external functions will be generated. 
c) If you don't dispose  <model> in CalcHEP directory, improve
   definition of CALCHEP variable in <model>/Makefile. It has to
   show the path to CalcHEP directory  which is used to dowload the file 
   with compiler flags.   
d) read README file attached to the model and make the corresponding changes 
   in Makefile if it needs. 
e) launch  'gmake' inside <model>. If 'gmake' is absent try 'make'. 
   The Makefile is written for 'gmake', but in modern platforms sometimes 
   'make' presents the 'gmake' command.  In results of compilation you 
    should get the mLib.a library.  
f) To add a new model to the list of models for your working sessions use the 
   "IMPORT OF MODELS" menu function. It asks you to define the directory 
    where model is disposed:
        Dir= <path to model>/<model>/models
    For expample, in case of MSSM disposed directly inside CalcHEP
        Dir= $CALCHEP/MSSM/models

6. To cite CalcHEP use the references written in the file 
      Reference.txt
    or get the same information by pressing the F9 key during 
    the CalcHEP interactive session.

7.  You can get a help during the session by pressing the F1 and 
    F2 keys. Read CalcHEP manual to get more information about the package.

In case of problem send a mail to 
     	
    calchep@googlegroups.com

8. To de-install the package call
    [g]make clean
and 
    [g]make clean 
    separately in each additionally installed  model directory.
