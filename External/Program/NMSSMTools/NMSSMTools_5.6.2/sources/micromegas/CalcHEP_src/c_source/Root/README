This directory is intended for generation of shared library  $CALCHEP/lib/ch_root.so
that can be downloaded in Root graphical system for automatic generation of
matrix elements.  See ch_class.h and ch_class.cc for structure of CalcHEP
ch_class for Root and its realization. In general ch_class can be enlarged
to include other CalcHEP functions presented in Section 10 of arXiv:1207.6082. 

To create file ch_root.so open Makefile, define ROOT variable which has to
contain path to Root and call 'make'. 
In case of problem check Root compilation flags  presented in variable
MAKESHAREDLIB defined in file root/include/compiledata.h.
