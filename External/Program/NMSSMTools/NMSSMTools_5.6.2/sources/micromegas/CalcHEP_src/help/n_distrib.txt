      Distributions
   Here you can specify distributions, which will be filled during the
 Monte Carlo sessions. For one-dimensional distributions only the first
 3 columns need be specified.  For two-dimensional distributions, all
 6 columns should be specified.  The syntax is similar to the cuts
 syntax.
 
    The first and fourth columns are where the user specifies the 
  phase space functions that they would like to histogram.  In general 
  it is defined with a key name followed by a list of the  OUTGOING 
  particles. For example, "M(u,D)" would give the invariant mass of the
  quark pair.  
    There are 3 special parameters   which allow to test incoming particle
  distribution: 'E1', 'E2' - energies of first and second incoming 
  particles and   M12   - total  CMS energy.


  For outgoing particles the available key names are:

  A  - Angle in degree unit
  C  - Cosine of angle 
  D  -  min(T1^2,T2^2)*(cosh(eta_12)-cos(phi_12))
        where T1,T2 - transverce momena, eta_12 - pseudo-rapidity
        difference, phi_12 - azimuth angle difference.      
  J  - Delta R jet separation = sqrt(|eta_12|^2 +|phi_12|^2)
  K  - |eta_12|
  F  - azimuth angle[rad] between 2 particles
  E  - Energy of the particle set
  M  - Mass of the particle set 
  P  - Cosine of the angle between the first particle in the list and 
       the direction of boosting of the particle set into the rest 
       frame of the particles set
  T  - Transverse momentum (P_t) of the particle set 
  S  - Squared mass
  Y  - Rapidity of the particle set
  N  - Pseudo-rapidity of the particle set
  Z  - Transverse energy
  U  - User defined function 

 Particle separators 'D','J','K' need two arguments.
 In general 'A' and 'C' take 2 arguments. But, in the case of a
 collision, these functions with one argument designate the angle
 between the given particle and the first (in the list) incoming
 particle.
   One can use the names of particles which are involved in others 
 subprocesses. But for a given Monte Carlo session CalcHEP fills only 
 the distributions related to the current subprocess.
 
   Sometimes the list of outgoing particles contains identical particles
 such as in the case of the process "e,E->A,A,A". For such a process,
 the histogram sums the observable for all combinations.  For example the
 "E(A)" would histogram  the energies of all photons.  
 Similarly, "M(A,A)" would histogram   invariant masses of              
 all photon pairs. 
   This behavior can be modified with the '^'/'_' symbols.  The result
 of adding these to the function name is to only histogram the observable
 with the maximum/minimum value of the phase space function. For example,
 "E_(A)" would only histogram the photon with the smallest energy.
 Similarly, "E^(A)" would only histogram the photon with the highest 
 energy.

   One can also use the composite name 'Jet' which is interpreted as the
 5 light quarks and the gluon.  All possible combinations are summed 
 over and binned as in the case of identical particles.
 
   User defined distributions can also be applied. They are specified by
 a string beginning with the letter 'U' as in 'U<character_set>' where 
 <character_set> is any set of ascii characters.  In this case, CalcHEP
 will call the function usrfun("abc").  It is up to the user to write 
 (or modify) the function "double usrfun(char * name)" and link it to 
 their model using the "Libraries" section of the model definition.  
 An example of this function is located at $CALCHEP/utile/usrfun.c 
 which can be modified by the user to fit their needs.  Further details
 can be found in the CalcHEP manual.
 
   The 'Min' and 'Max' columns define the range of the distribution. The
 limits can be specified with numbers or formulas which contain 
 numbers, model parameters and standard operations such as 
 "(,),+,-,/,*,**,sqrt()".

   To view the plots use the "Display Distributions" menu function.
 After the end of each Monte Carlo session CalcHEP saves the generated 
 distributions in the 'result/distr_#' file where # designates the 
 session number.  They can be viewed later by running  
       $CALCHEP/bin/show_distr  result/distr_# 
 Distributions from various subprocesses can be summed using the
 command  
        $CALCHEP/bin/sum_distr   distr_1 distr_2 ... >sum
