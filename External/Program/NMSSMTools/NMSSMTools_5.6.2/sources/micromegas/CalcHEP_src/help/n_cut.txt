      Cuts
   This table specifies cuts on the phase space. A phase space function
 is described in the second column. Its limits are defined in the third
 and the fourth columns. If one of these fields is empty then a one-side
 cut is applied. 
   In general the phase space function is defined by its name, which 
 characterizes  the type of cut, and an outgiong  particle list for 
 which the cut is  applied. For example, "T(u)" means the transverse 
 momentum  of the 'u'-quark.  "T(u,D)" means the transverse momentum  of
 the quark pair.

   The following cut functions are available:
   
  A  - Angle in degree units
  C  - Cosine of angle
  D  -  min(T1^2,T2^2)*(cosh(eta_12)-cos(phi_12))
        where T1,T2 - transverce momena, eta_12 - pseudo-rapidity 
        difference, phi_12 - azimuth angle difference.   
  J  - Delta R jet separation = sqrt(|eta_12|^2 +|phi_12|^2)
  K  - |eta_12|
  F  - azimuth angle[rad]  between 2 particles
  E  - Energy of the particle set
  M  - Mass of the particle set
  P  - Cosine of the angle between the first particle in the list and 
       the direction of boosting of the particle set into the rest 
       frame of the particles set
  T  - Transverse momentum (P_t) of the particle set
  Y  - Rapidity of the particle set 
  N  - Pseudo-rapidity of the particle set
  Z  - Transverse energy

 Particle separators 'D','J','K' need 2 arguments.  
 Generally 'A' and 'C' have 2 arguments. But in the case of a collision
 process, the functions 'A' and 'C' with one argument designate the 
 angle between the given  particle and the first (in the list) incoming
 particle.
   One can construct cuts using the names of the particles which are
 involved in other subprocesses. For a given Monte Carlo session cuts 
 for  particles which are absent in the current session are ignored.    
  
   Sometimes the list of outgoing particles contains identical particles
 such as in the case of the process "e,E->A,A,A". For such a process,
 the cut is applied to each of the identical particles.  For example the
 cut "E(A)" is applied to each of the photons.  Similarly, "J(A,A)"  
 is applied to all photon pairs.
   This behavior can be modified with the '^'/'_' symbols. The result of
 adding these to the function name is to apply the cut to the particle
 with the maximum/minimum value of the phase space function. For example,
 "E_(A)" would only apply the cut to the photon with the smallest energy.
 Similarly, "E^(A)" would only apply the cut to the photon with the
 highest energy.  To further illustrate this, consider the following cut:
 
| |Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
| | E(A)      |   20        |  100

 which could also be written as 

| |Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
| | E^(A)     |             |   100 
| | E_(A)     |  20         |   
 
   One can also use the composite name 'Jet' which is interpreted as the
 5 light quarks and the gluon.  For example, the cut "T(Jet)" would 
 apply the transverse mass cut to all 5 light quarks and the gluon.

 In addition, the first column in the cut Table can be used to comment 
 (%) or to reverse (!) the cut. For example, the following cut:
 
| |Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
|!| E(A)      |   20        |  100

 means that the photon must have E(A)<20 or E(A)>100 which is just the
 opposite of the cut without the "!". A % in the first column causes the
 cut to be ignored.
 
   The limits of the cuts can also be defined by an algebraic formula
 which contains numbers and model parameters.  Parentheses "()" and 
 the standard operations "+,-,/,*,**,sqrt()" are also permitted.  As an 
 example, the following cuts the e,E pair to have an invariant mass
 within 10GeV of the mass of the Z boson:
 
| |Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
| | M(e,E)    | MZ-10       | MZ+10
 
   User defined cuts can also be applied. They are specified by a string
 beginning with the letter 'U' as in 'U<character_set>' where 
 <character_set> is any set of ascii characters.  For example, consider
 the cut:
 
| |Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
| | Uabc      |   20        |  100

 In this case, CalcHEP will call the function usrfun("abc"). It is up to
 the user to write (or modify) the function "double usrfun(char * name)"
 and link it to their model using the "Libraries" section of the model
 definition.  An example of this function is located at 
 $CALCHEP/utile/usrfun.c which can be modified by the user to fit their
 needs.  Further details can be found in the CalcHEP manual.

 For collision processes one can  apply cut on energies of first and
 second incoming particles and CMS total energy. Cut parameters 'E1','E2' 
 and 'M12' should be used in this case.
