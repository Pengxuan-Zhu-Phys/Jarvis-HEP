The first two functions of this menu allow to set
limits of Feynman 'x' variable for the plot. The
permitted input must satisfy the condition
               0 <= x-Min < xMax <=1
 The third position allows  to define the number
of points which will be used to draw the plot. The
hight limit for this input is 150.
 The next menu position allows to set a value of
QCD scale, which is a hidden parameter of hadron
structure functions.
  At last, the 'Display plot' menu function draws
plot on the screen.

Note,that the first and the last points of the plot
will have Feynman 'x' parameter equal to x_Min + dx
and x_Max-dx correspondingly, where 
dx=(x_Max-x_Min)/2/Npoints. Consequently, the
dangerous points x=0 and x=1 will never appear on 
the plot.
