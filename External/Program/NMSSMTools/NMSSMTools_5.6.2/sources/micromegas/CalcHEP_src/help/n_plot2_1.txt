CalcHEP  presents the value of function via areas
of the boxes 
   S ~  F^P 
By default, P=1. This menu position  gives you a
possibility to change P. If P=2 then linear sizes
of boxes will be proportion to function. The 
option P<<1 allows us to see boxes which are 
invisible at the default P=1 case.
