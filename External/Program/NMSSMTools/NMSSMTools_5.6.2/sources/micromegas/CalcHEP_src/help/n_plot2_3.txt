3 5 50 Plot
  This menu function provides the user a
possibility to save current graphical image of
the plot in the LaTeX format. We use Axodraw
commands to write axes, lines and curves.
   The Axodraw syntax is very easy and you can
alter the CalcHEP output to get some local
correction in picture if any.
    Before the file writing CalcHEP gives you a
possibility to change the picture and letter
sizes.
  After  the file writing CalcHEP informs you
about the file name used for the output.
