In general CalcHEP does not include widths in
t-channel propagators. In order to force CalcHEP
to insert t-channel width one has to change
   "Width in t-channels  OFF" 
switch in symbolic mode. The corresponding menu
is activated by the F5  key.  

  If it was done, this menu function allows you
to exclude widths from t-channel propagators.
But for standard configuration
 "Width in t-channels  OFF"
this menu function has not any influence on 
numerical results.
