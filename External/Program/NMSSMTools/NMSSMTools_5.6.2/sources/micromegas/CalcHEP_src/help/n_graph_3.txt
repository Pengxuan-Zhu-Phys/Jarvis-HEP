5 5 52   Gnuplot 
  This command generates '.gp' file which can 
be used as input file for gnuplot graphical system.
In particular it  contains instruction to read
plotDataFile generated by upper level menu function.
Extention of plotDataFile is replaced on '.gp'. 
The user can edit 'gp' file to improve  plot
visualization. To work with gnuplot use the 
following commands: 

    > gnuplot
    gnuplot> load "plotDataFile.gp"
    gnuplot> exit

To generate postscript output use the command:

   > gnuplot > plot_N.eps
   gnuplot> set terminal postscript eps 22
   gnuplot> load "plotDataFile.gp"
   gnuplot> exit

To generate LaTeX output one needs to repeat the 
same trick  using 
gnuplot> set terminal latex 
command. Then LaTeX subscripts and superscripts 
will be taken into account properly. See 
http://www.gnuplot.info/files/tutorial.pdf
for details.
