1 10 55   Reduce output
  This menu function saves results of symbolic
calculation into the files. For each subprocess the
file sum#.red is created, where # is the subprocess
number. So, for the more typical case of one
subprocess, the result will be written in the file
sum1.red.
  The output  file contains algebraic expression for
all diagrams of subprocess, written in the notation of
symbolic manipulation system 'REDUCE'.
