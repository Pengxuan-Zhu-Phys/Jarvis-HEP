All parameters and constraints involved in 
calculations are permitted in the input. Use the PI
symbol for the pi constant. The integer numbers are
treated as decimal ones, so 1/3 is not zero, but

before the dot should be written. 
  The brackets are permitted. Standard mathematical
functions :sqrt,sin,cos,tan,asin,acos,atan,exp,log,
fabs,atan2 can be used. Use ^ for power.
