This is a menu of generated subprocesses

Any menu record consists of four parts
1. a subprocess number,
2. a subprocess name,
3. the number of deleted diagrams,
4. the number of undeleted diagrams.

If you  activate a menu function, the graphic 
image of Feynman diagrams for a highlighted 
subprocess will be displayed.
  The F7 key may be used to remove all diagrams
in the highlighted subprocess.
