 The enter of value of helicity of the second incoming particle.
 This option is available if process in symbolic session was 
 specified in the corresponding manner with the % symbol after 
 particle name. Note that helicity is defined as a projection 
 of spin on the direction of motion. So,the input value is 
 restricted by +/- particle spin. Left SM fermion has 
 helicity  -0.5. Helicity of left anti-fermion is +0.5
