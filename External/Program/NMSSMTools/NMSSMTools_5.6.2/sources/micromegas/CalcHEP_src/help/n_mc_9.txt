 'Kinematics' gives you a possibility to choose a
parameterization of phase space. The right choice
of parameterization is needed for a successful
work of the 'Regularization' program.
  The parameterizations used by CalcHEP are 
defined by the  scheme of recursive  1->2 decays 
of the incoming state into the outgoing particles.
