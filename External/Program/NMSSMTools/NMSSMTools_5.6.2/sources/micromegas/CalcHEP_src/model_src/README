This directory contains LanHEP source files for SM and Inert Doublet Model.

LanHEP code is available by http://theory.sinp.msu.ru/~semenov/lanhep.html

Inert Doublet Models is realized according to  
  Lopez Honorez, Laura and Yaguna, Carlos E.,
  "The inert doublet model of dark matter revisited"
  JHEP,09 (2010),046, arXiv:1003.3125[hep-ph]

Model compilation
  lhep -ca sm.lhep     # for SM 
  lhep -ca idm.lhep    # for IDM 

sm.inc  is included both into sm.lhep and idm.lhep

Compilation flags:

hgg  On/Off    if "On", effective vertices for Higgs-glue-glue and         
               Higgs-gamma-gamma are added.                                
               Glue-glue vertex is normalozed on Mh.                       
               RQCDh takes into account cadiation corrections to           
               Higgs-glue-glue for case of Higgs decay. Higgs-3glue 
               and Higgs-4glue are ommited. 
h4G  On/Off    Includes Higgs-3glue and Higgs-4glue vertices.
