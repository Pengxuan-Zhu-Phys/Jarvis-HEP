    *Dear Users: If you don't need EDMs, commenting out the 
                 subroutine FILLEDMS in "cpsuperh2.f" may 
                 significantly decrease computer running time

(3) 03/Oct/2008: The 2-loop Higgs-mediated contribution to 
                 the quark CEDMs corrected

(4) 28/Apr/2009: 

    (4)-1 : The signs of the fermionic 2-loop Higgs-mediated 
            contributions to EDMs and CEDMs have been corrected

    (4)-2 : The array SSPARA_H has been extended to include 
            the A terms of first two generations

    (4)-3 : The subroutine FILLMUON (fillmuon.f) has been added 
            for the calculations of the electric and anomalous 
            magnetic dipole moments of the muon, see arXiv:0904.4352

    (4)-4 : The obsolete subroutine HiggsEDM (higgsedm.f) has 
            been removed

(5) 10/Jun/2009: cpsuperh2.f, fillcoupl2.f and fillgambr2.f improved

     (5)-1 : The arguments of the subrourine FILLGAMBR2 is extended
             to included SMPARA_H and SSPARA_H arrays

     (5)-2 : IFLAG_H(56)=2 for tachyonic third-generation squarks
             IFLAG_H(56)=3 for tachyonic first two-generation squarks

     (5)-3 : When the tan_beta-enhanced threshold corrections are 
             encoded in the down-type quark Yukawa coulings in a
             form of h_q = (h_q)^0 / (1 + Delta_q tan_beta)

             CAUX_H(10): complex Delta_b
             CAUX_H(11): complex Delta_s

     (5)-4 : Top-quark decays are calculated including the leading-order
             QCD corrections and the threshold corrections. The results 
             are stored as follows

             RAUX_H(50): Gamma(t -> W  b)

     (7)-1 : New structure introduced

             The main program CPsuperH in the file "cpsuperh2.f" now consists 
             of the following three new subroutines

             FILLINIT2     provided by fillinit2.f
             FILLCPsuperH2 provided by fillcpsuperh2.f
             AURUN         provided by aurun.f

     (7)-2 : More two-loop EDMS involving charginos and neutralinos included
             (see arXiv:1006.3087 by Ellis, Lee, Pilaftsis)

             RAUX_H(205): electron EDM by the gamma-W-H coupling
             RAUX_H(206): electron EDM by the gamma-W-W coupling

             RAUX_H(225): down-quark EDM by the gamma-W-H coupling
             RAUX_H(226): down-quark EDM by the gamma-W-W coupling

             RAUX_H(235): strange-quark EDM by the gamma-W-H coupling
             RAUX_H(236): strange-quark EDM by the gamma-W-W coupling

             *the new contributions are to be printed by taking IFLAG_H(18)=2
