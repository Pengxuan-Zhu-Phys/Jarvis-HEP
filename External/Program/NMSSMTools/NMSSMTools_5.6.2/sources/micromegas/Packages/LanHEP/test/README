To make test run,

1) be sure you have already compiled LanHEP ('make' command
   in the previous directory)

2) run LanHEP, type in this directory:
 ../lhep -co -OutDir tmp input/stand.mdl

3) Files are created in tmp/ subdirectory, compare them with
  reference data in output/ subdirectory. Type
 diff output/ tmp/

  This command should give to output if the data are identical
  in both directories.
