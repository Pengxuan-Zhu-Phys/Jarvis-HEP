This are files to generate MSSM and extensions. 
The main file is susy.mdl, so the model is generated by
../lhep susy
command. susy*.mdl files contains different parts of MSSM,
they are included from susy.mdl. The files *.c contain numerical
routines to evaluate MSSM parameters. They can be called from 
LanHEP (to test numerically the mass matrix) via dynamic library
interface. Type
make
to create dynamic libraries. In case of problems while creating
fhf3.so, try 
make FORTLIB="-lg2c"
or specify another library with FORTRAN system routines.
