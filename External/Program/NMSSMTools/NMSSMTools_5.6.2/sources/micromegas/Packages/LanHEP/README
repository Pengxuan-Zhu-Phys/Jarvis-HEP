To create the executable file  lhep, type 'make' with default model format: 
make Output=CompHEP
    - for CompHEP default output format;
make Output=CalcHEP
    - for CalcHEP default output format;
make Output=FeynArts
    - for FeynArts 6.x default output format;

In any case, the output format can be specified by the command line
option (-ca for CalcHEP; -co for CompHEP; -fa for FeynArts; -tex for LaTeX). 
The archive also contains the directory  mdl  with startup file and 
examples for several physical models. Add the directory containing 
LanHEP to your PATH environment variable. Then LanHEP can be started 
from any other directory, it can find automatically files from the  
'mdl'  directory.

Files in this directory:

*.[ch] - program source and header files
Makefile - file used by 'make' command

mdl/feynarts.rc - startup file for FeynArts mode
mdl/qcd.mdl     - QCD example
mdl/sm_brst.mdl - BRST setup for Standard model
mdl/sm_tex.mdl  - LaTeX names for Standard model particles and parameters
mdl/lhep.rc     - default LanHEP startup file 
mdl/qeddip.mdl  - QED with electron dipole momentum
mdl/smnlg.mdl   - Standard model with Non-linear Gauge Fixing
mdl/stand.mdl   - Standard model
mdl/newsm.mdl   - Standard model currently used by CompHEP
mdl/qed.mdl     - QED
